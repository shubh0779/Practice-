        The mighty chunks rise all over the world, including the oceans. They usually have steep, sloping sides and
        sharp or rounded ridges, and a high point, called a peak or summit. Most geologists classify a mountain as a
        landform that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) or more above its surrounding area. A mountain range is a
        series or chain of mountains that are close together.
